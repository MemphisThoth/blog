# About Myself

I have had a passion for technology from a young age. My parents bought me a TRS-80 Color Computer 2 when I was ten years old.

The TRS-80 had a cassette tape machine for storage, and a whole 64kB of memory. What I liked best about it though was that it came with a BASIC programming language interpreter. I plowed through the book that came with it, and I wrote many programs using BASIC.

A few years later, my parents bought me a Tandy 1000 HX. It came with a floppy disk drive, and I used a television for a monitor. The computer came with MS-DOS 2.11. The guy at Radio Shack gave me a book on DOS, and  he told me I could come back for the advanced book when I was done with the basics. Well, it took me a weekend before I needed the advanced book.

Back then, if you wanted a c or c++ compiler, you had to pay serious money for it. So, I never had a chance to learn those programming languages at the time.

In high school I went to a vocational school, and I studied graphic design. We had some powerful Apple Macintosh computers at the time. I claimed one that used a color monitor, and a 10 megabyte hard drive. We learned programs like PageMaker, Freehand, and Photoshop. Photoshop was version 2.5 at the time. I did well in that class, and it helped me for when I graduated school.

I started my career at a young age. While my friends were off to college, I was working at a printing company service bureau that specialized in color graphics. 

The business was high tech. Almost everyone there had a computer. I had a Mac Quadra 950 with a one gigabyte hard drive. The case was huge, and the hard drive on its own weighed over twenty pounds. 

I was good at diagnosing problems with computers. My coworkers would come to me for help rather than disturb our general manager.

We had Macintosh computers of course, some IBM PCs, and Unix workstations. I ws taught how to operate them.

One time, we had a man come from AGFA. His mission was to convert the Unix workstation files into Postscript files that could be manipulated on a Macintosh or PC computer. The computer he used was an IBM system with OS/2 Warp installed on it. I asked him if I should learn to use OS/2. He looked around the room, and told me to learn them all. So, that is what I did.

I bought a whole bunch of books on computers. One was Unix System Administration from O'Reilly. It helped me the most. I was made a part time system administrator. The company I worked for started a new policy of "do it ourselves". This saved the company a boat load of money. I was paid well for it.
