        <h1>My Workstation Computer</h1>
<p>I have a Lenovo ThinkStation p520 for my personal computer. Compared to my small for factor Lenovo with a Intel Core i5-6400, it's pretty awesome.</p>
<p>I bought it off eBay for about $250. Eight years ago it cost at least $1,500. It came with an Intel Xeon w-2135, a 512GB nvme ssd, and 64GB of memory.</p>
<p>I upgraded my p520 with another 4TB nvme, a WIFI 6 wireless adapter, and added an AMD RX 6600 video card.</p>
<p>My father's computer and mine are very similar. His has a Core i7-8700. Both processors have 6 cores and 12 threads, and they run at 3.7Ghz. However, mine uses the Skylake architecture, and his uses the newer Coffelake.</p>
<p>It's not the fastest computer, but it's fast enough for me.</p>
<p>If you're looking for older computers that still run great, you should choose this one.</p>
