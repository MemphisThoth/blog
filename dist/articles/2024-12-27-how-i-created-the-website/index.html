        <h1>How I Created this Webiste.</h1>
<p>I made this website with the <a href="https://11ty.dev">11ty</a> static site generator. It is simple to learn if you follow the documentation and tutorial blogs. It is all based on JavaScript using node.js.</p>
<p>I first started by initializin git. I then started a package.json file. I added the 11ty packages. I modified the package.json file by adding the scripts to build and serve the development environment to demonstrate my work.</p>
<p>Later, I created the layout templates as html files with the liquid template syntax. I divided the header and footer markup into thier own files so I didn't have to repeat the markup multiple times.</p>
<p>I then made some dummy posts to tet that it worked. On the home page, I made it loop through the collection of blog posts, and then displayed them as a list.</p>
<p>Once the site was functioning correctly, I used <a href="https://postcss.org">PostCSS</a> to style the website. PostCSS has some awesome plugins to manipulate css files. I specifically used postcss-import and postcss-preset-env. They concatenated my css files and future proofed them for things like nested styles.</p>
<p>After making the website responsive, and looking good, I pushed it to github and setup a Netlify account to host it.</p>
